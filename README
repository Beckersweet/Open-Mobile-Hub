Open Mobile Hub
===============

Open Mobile Hub is a mobile supercomputing hub where individuals, experts, and big data meet to solve real world problems.

We are building a distributed supercomputer made of smartphones and tablets, turning mobile devices into a peer-to-peer research platform for science hobbyists.

The current Android-based prototype (version 0.0.1) for the Open Mobile Hub platform is a virtual machine (VM) image of the Ubuntu operating system running Mininet. It allows Android devices to connect to the VM root node that interfaces with the virtual network and its POX controller. The root node also has a port 8080 that connects to a web interface to monitor the connected devices.

Our initial benchmark (sum calculation) is deployed in parallel over the distributed Android devices. We call Open Mobile Hub a "mobile supercomputer" as it runs and accelerates the execution of apps within the mobile network.

In the long term, we also want Open Mobile Hub to include traditional supercomputing resources as additional peer resources.

Our final goal is to allow citizen scientists and academic researchers to collaborate via mobile devices to implement projects like Folding@home in a flexible, heterogeneous, power-aware, and failure-aware (i.e. responsive) computing and collaborative environment.
